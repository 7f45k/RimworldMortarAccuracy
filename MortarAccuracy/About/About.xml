<name>Mortar Accuracy</name>

<targetVersion>1.0.0</targetVersion>
<description>Instead of mortars having a fixed spread radius of 13 tiles and having a miss chance due to cover, the cover miss chance is removed and a colonist's Intellectual and/or Shooting skill will affect a mortar's accuracy.

By default, a colonist with maximum skill will improve a mortar's accuracy to 75%. A colonist with no skill will affect a mortar's accuracy by -40%. These values can be changed in Mod Settings (can set everyone's accuracy to perfect 100% accuracy if desired)

This affects all mortar shots, including enemy mortars.

Supports other mods:
[WD] Expanded Artillery: mortars and cannons accuracy is affected by this mod
More Vanilla Turrets: rocket and charge blast turret accuracy is affected by this mod

Load order does not matter to affect either of these mods.
